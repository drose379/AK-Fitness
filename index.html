          <h3>Alicia Kelly</h3>

          <p>
            I got into fitness at a young age. Wanting to workout and be fit without making it a chore was important to me so I decided to train myself in college. After all I was doing it for me. At first I had no personal accountability and skipped the gym often. Going cold turkey on fitness,
I went full fledge into a lifestyle of drinking and pizza binging.
          </p>

          <p>
            After assessing myself during winter break I came to the conclusion that the freshmen 25 weight gain didn’t look too good on me. After a hard winter I came into spring semester anxious, depressed and feeling the worst I’ve ever felt. Instead of eating clean I was loading my body and mind with toxic chemicals and food that had no benefit to me. No wonder I didn’t feel good!
          </p>

          <p>
            I decided to get back into the lifestyle that made me feel great. I was tired of hearing the same excuses come up in my head. There is no doubt that my body was telling me to wake up! This was the first wake up call towards my personal journey of health and fitness
          </p>

          <p>
            I started working out 5 days a week no matter how bad I felt. As the semester went on and my drinking and pizza binging decreased I started feeling like myself again. This time much stronger, toned and back to my regular weight! The key here is I was consistent and followed my own programming while listening to my body. Throughout the years my journey has not been easy as I have endured several injuries and physical illnesses along the way. When my life was falling apart I always counted on fitness and taking care of myself to get me out of the rut I was in. I fell in love with the process of bettering myself and now love to share it with others. 4 years ago I became a certified personal trainer with every intention to encourage everyone to discover the greatest versions of themselves.
